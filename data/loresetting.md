# Tales of the Walrus Archipelago

## The World: Oceanus Borealis
The world is a vast, cold ocean dotted with mysterious islands, floating iceberg cities, and ancient structures rising from the deep. The tech level is "magitech," where ancient, glowing runestones (often referred to generically as "Relics" or "Shards") power crude machinery.

### Factions

### Key Locations

*   **The Frostspire:** A massive, crystalline tower in the center of the frozen north, said to be the source of all magic.
*   **Runegate Harbor:** The largest trading hub, built inside the ribcage of a colossal, ancient sea beast.
*   **The Whispering abyss:** A deep trench where strange lights are seen, and ships often vanish.
*   **Shardfall Isles:** An archipelago where glowing meteorites constantly rain down, providing valuable but dangerous resources.

### Historical Events

*   **The Great Thaw:** Centuries ago, the ice caps melted rapidly, swallowing the old world and forcing civilization onto ships and high peaks.
*   **The Night of Green Fire:** A celestial event where the sky burned green, mutating sea life and awakening dormant runestones.
*   **The Covenant Schism:** A civil war within the Lighthouse Covenant over the use of forbidden shadow-magic to keep the beacons lit.

### The "Walrus" (In-Lore)
In this world, "The Great Walrus" (or sometimes just "The Tusked One") is a mythical, sleeping god-beast said to dream the world into existence. Its "whiskers" are the ley lines of magic that crisscross the ocean.
*   *Relays/Nodes* are called **"Whisker-Stones"** or **"Echo-Shrines"**.
*   *Blobs* are referred to as **"Memory-Urns"** or **"Thought-Bubbles"**.
*   *Uploading* is called **"Communing"** or **"Inscribing"**.

### The WALiors (Wakened Arcane Ley-line Intercessors)
WALiors are not mere machines or simple spirits. They are unique entities born from the resonance between a "Whisker-Stone" and a mortal soul.

*   **Nature:** They exist as semi-corporeal projections or inhabit small, portable runestone constructs. They feed on knowledge and shared experiences. A WALior's "mind" is a tapestry woven from the memories it collects.
*   **Origin:** It is said that when the Great Walrus dreams, fragments of its vast intellect drift through the ley lines. A skilled summoner can catch one of these fragments and bind it to a WALior core.
*   **The Bond:** A WALior is linked to its summoner. They grow and evolve based on their travels together. A WALior without a companion is a "Fading Echo," doomed to lose its memories to the void.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   *The Guide:* To navigate the treacherous currents and mists of Oceanus Borealis using their connection to the ley lines.
    *   *The Chronicler:* To witness and remember events in a world where history is constantly being washed away by the Great Thaw.
    *   *The Anchor:* To keep their summoner sane and grounded amidst the eldritch horrors of the deep.
